class CircularBufferURL:
    """
    Base class for a cuplcodec URL.

    This includes at least a circular buffer with a long string of base64 encoded sample data and
    a short status field.

    Instantiation decodes the status string first. It contains error information from the microcontroller running
    the encoder.

    Next it locates the :ref:`ENDSTOP_BYTE` in the circular buffer string. Characters to its left are the newest.
    Characters to its right are the oldest. The circular buffer is unwrapped into a string where :ref:`ENDSTOP_BYTE` is
    the last character and the oldest data is in the first.

    The linearised buffer is further divided into two parts:
    The endstop string (including the endstop itself) are at the end. It contains metadata such as the number of
    samples in the payload. This is preceded by the payload string, which contains a list base64-encocded
    environmental sensor readings. These are in chronological order oldest-to-newest reading left-to-right.

    The decoding of the payload string is handled elsewhere.

    Parameters
        ----------
        statb64 : str
            Base64 encoded status string extract from a URL parameter.
        circb64 : str
            A long string containing base64 encoded samples that are organised as a circular buffer.
